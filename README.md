#### Grocery Store Sales Prediction

Project Overview
This project uses machine learning models to predict the profit of loyal customer' transaction. The dataset is the grocery store sales based on historical transaction data. By analyzing both numerical features (e.g., sales amount, discounts) and categorical features (e.g., product category, customer name), the goal is to build a predictive model that helps retailers forecast profits and communicate with loyal customers.
